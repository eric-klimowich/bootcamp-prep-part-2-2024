# CLI vs. GUI

## Learning Objective

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

* Understand the differences between the CLI and GUI.

## GUIs

When most computer users want to find files on their computers, they use a graphical user interface (GUI). For example, on a Mac, you’d click the **Finder** icon, while on a Windows computer, you’d select the **My Computer** icon.

When developers navigate their computers, they tend to use the command line interface — commonly referred to as the “command line,” or “CLI.”

## What is the CLI?

You're already familiar with GUIs or Graphical User Interfaces. A GUI lets users interact with programs, files, and settings through visually-driven interactions. The CLI lets users interact with programs, files, and settings through text instead of graphical elements.

We interact with this interface by typing commands on the command line and then executing them. Everyday tasks you would accomplish from a GUI can also be performed in the CLI. For example, creating, modifying, and deleting files and directories, launching apps, changing application/system settings, and more.

## Your Wish is its Command

Until video display was introduced in the mid-1960s, the command line was the only means of interacting with a computer. Today, the CLI is still preferred by programmers because it’s explicit, fast, and extremely versatile.

We can perform actions using the command line by **entering commands**.

There’s a command to perform virtually any task on your computer. 

No, there isn’t a `self destruct` command. However, there *are* commands for opening applications, creating new files, and copying files from one place to another — you know, real-life practical stuff.

## Why CLI?

The command line interacts with computers more directly by using text instead of graphics to represent file folders and file types. In essence, the command line is more efficient for developers because it allows them to talk more directly to the computer.

For the rest of this lesson, we’re going to walk through some of the most common commands developers use in the terminal. 

We _highly_ recommend that you follow along on your own! 

If we may offer some more unsolicited advice, we also suggest getting comfortable with a shortcut: `command + tab` on Mac and `alt + tab` on Windows. 

This will allow you to quickly toggle between the browser on which you’re viewing this lesson and your CLI.
