### Time

TBD

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

* Explain the command line and why developers use it.
* Navigate through your computer’s files structure via the CLI.

## Introduction

In this lesson, you'll be accessing your computer’s command line interface (CLI) and start using it to navigate your computer.

Like power tools, commands should be used only as directed. You are now speaking directly to your computer, and it’s possible to execute commands with unintended consequences if you type some seemingly random letters into your terminal.

If you stick to using commands as instructed in this lesson, you’ll be safe.
